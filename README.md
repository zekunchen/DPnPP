The "Jac" folder contains COMSOL + MATLAB simulation files. These can generate electric field data and reference conductivity. Afterwards, you can calculate the Jacobian matrix based on the formula (please modify the path before use; the files are already complete)

Run "Demo_Case1_UNNP.ipynb" for an example. (Using the pytorch)

This code package is a Python implementation of UNNP. DPnPP is implemented based on this UNNP code (DPnPP_code.png is the core code for gradient calculation). Please reproduce it according to this code and the formulas in the paper. Or based on the source code provided in this paper, “A Plug-and-Play Deep Image Prior.(https://github.com/zhaodongsun/pnp_dip/tree/master)”

Please cite our paper if this code is used to motivate any publications.
